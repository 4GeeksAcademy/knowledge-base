You will be assigned a Spreadsheet document containing the User Test Cases and a report for the Issues. If you haven't received it yet, please ask your career advisor to share it with you.

## Weekly Task:

Every week, you are required to update the document by adding each of the bugs that you reported, confirmed, labeled, cleaned, and the ones you have questions about. Follow the steps below:

1. **Access the Document:**
   - Open the Spreadsheet document shared with you by your career advisor.

2. **Update the Document:**
   - Add the date you worked on each bug.
   - Provide the link to the bug.
   - Add a label that describes the activity. It could be one of the following:
     - Reported
     - Closed
     - Confirmed
     - Solved
     - Suggestion

Consistently updating the Bug Reporting and Management Spreadsheet will ensure that all reported bugs are properly tracked and addressed. This organized approach will contribute to the overall effectiveness of the bug resolution process.
