Important Libraries:

- The whole project is built using `Material UI`, basically like a bootstrap library but built by Google. We are using a particular implementation made for react.js, a [here is the documentation](https://material-ui.com/).
- We use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for HTTP Requests (we don't use fetch API, but axios is very similar).
- We use the [Matx React theme](https://admin-theme.vercel.app/session/signin) as the base for this project, [here is the code](https://github.com/alesanchezr/admin-theme) and here is [the documentation](http://demos.ui-lib.com/matx-react-doc/).
- We use `react-tostify` for notifications, [here is the documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify).
