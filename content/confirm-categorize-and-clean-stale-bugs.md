3. **Replicate or Confirm:**

   - Visit the website mentioned in the report to confirm if the bug is still present.

4. **Action Based on Confirmation:**
   - If the bug is still present:
     - Remove the stale label.
     - Add one or more of the following labels:
       - `Confirm`: If it was confirmed that the bug is still occurring.
       - `BUG`: If it is indeed a mistake.
       - `Front end`: If the bug is a frontend bug.
       - `Back end`: If the bug is a backend bug.
   - If you can't confirm the bug:
     - Add the label `âœ‹ waiting-for-feedback`.
     - Review it in the standup meeting.
   - If the bug is not happening:
     - Close the issue by adding a comment.


Following this procedure will help streamline the bug reporting and management process, ensuring that issues are properly identified, confirmed, and addressed in a timely manner.
